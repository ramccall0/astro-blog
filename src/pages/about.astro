			<h2>About Robert</h2>
			<p>
				Living in the heart of the Texas Hill Country, Robert has been around barbecue his entire
				life. Around the time he turned 18, Robert decided to save up and buy his first smoker, a
				tiny little 18in Weber Smokey Mountain. It served its purpose, smoking all sorts of
				meats ranging from pork shoulder to brisket. Eventually, Robert upgraded to his first-ever
				Cast Iron offset smoker from a local retailer in San Antonio. Ten years later, the smoker
				is still standing strong and producing amazing Texas barbecue!
			</p>

			<p>
				Throughout this time, Robert also started an Instagram page, BBQ Dropout, where he shares
				pictures of his barbecue journey. Additionally, he launched a YouTube channel to produce
				high-quality barbecue video content.
